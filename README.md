# OAuth 2.0 Overview

OAuth 2.0 is an open authorization protocol that enables secure access to user data between applications. It is widely used for granting third-party applications limited access to a user's resources without exposing the user's credentials.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Clients

In OAuth 2.0, a client is any application that wants to access a user's resources on a resource server. Clients can be categorized as confidential or public based on their ability to protect their credentials.

### 2. Resource Owner

The resource owner is the user who authorizes an application to access their resources. The resources can include personal data, photos, videos, or other types of user-specific information.

### 3. Authorization Server

The authorization server is responsible for authenticating the resource owner and issuing access tokens to the client after obtaining authorization.

### 4. Resource Server

The resource server hosts the protected resources. It is responsible for accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

### 5. Access Token

An access token is a string representing the authorization granted to the client. It is used to access protected resources on behalf of the resource owner.

## OAuth 2.0 Flow

OAuth 2.0 defines several authorization flows. One common flow is the Authorization Code Flow, which involves the following steps:

1. **Client Requests Authorization:**
   - The client initiates the flow by requesting authorization from the resource owner.

2. **User Authorizes the Client:**
   - The resource owner authorizes the client to access their resources.

3. **Authorization Grant:**
   - The authorization server issues an authorization grant, typically in the form of an authorization code.

4. **Token Request:**
   - The client uses the authorization code to request an access token from the authorization server.

5. **Access Token Issued:**
   - The authorization server validates the code and issues an access token.

6. **Accessing Protected Resources:**
   - The client uses the access token to access protected resources on the resource server.

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS to secure communication between the client, authorization server, and resource server.
- Protect client credentials, and use secure methods for storing and transmitting access tokens.
- Implement proper authorization checks on the resource server to ensure only authorized clients access protected resources.

## Conclusion

OAuth 2.0 provides a flexible and widely adopted framework for secure, delegated access to user resources. Understanding its key concepts and flows is essential for developing secure and interoperable applications.
